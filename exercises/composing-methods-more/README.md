In this series of exercises, we practice various refactoring techniques. You may want to run pylint on this script to find any pep8 compliance issues. Fix as much as issues you can.

## TODO
- [ ] Exercise 7: 'Split Temporary Variable' Technique
  - Study the files [burger_toppings.py](burger_toppings.py) and use `split temporary variable` technique to clarify the code (make it easier to understand its intent.)

  - Study the file [kinetic_energy.py](kinetic_energy.py). Use `remove assignment to method parameter` technique to prevent future mistakes/bugs.

- [ ] Exercise 9: 'Rename Method' Technique
  - Study the file [calculate_area.py](calculate_area.py). Use `rename method` technique to clarify the code (make it easier to understand its intent.)

- [ ] Exercise 10: 'Split Temporary Variable' Technique
  - Study the file [kinetic_energy.py](kinetic_energy.py). Use `split temporary variable` technique to clarify the code (make it easier to understand its intent.)
