## Repository Setup

:warning: **Important:** Please follow [these instructions](Setup.md) exactly to set up your clone of this course repository.

## Course Description

This course focuses on advanced topics such as debugging, unit testing, refactoring and design patterns. Students apply these concepts to existing portfolio projects to improve code qualities such as readability, modularity and extensibility. Topics covered include: debugging techniques, unit-testing, refactoring techniques, design patterns and navigating massive codebases. By the end of the course, students have practical knowledge of writing python unit tests, refactoring legacy code and implementing some design patterns.

## Prerequisites

- CS 1.0 - INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING
- CS 1.1 - OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

## Course Specifics

**Course Delivery**: hybrid | 7 weeks | 14 sessions

**Course Credits**: 3 units | 37.5 Seat Hours | 75 Total Hours

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to ...

1. Compare and contrast design patterns common to many software development disciplines.
1. Produce elegant pseudocode to quickly describe how to solve a problem.
1. Design and implement code refactoring techniques to improve code readability, quality, and craftsmanship.
1. Apply debugging and unit testing best practices to improve quality assurance.

## Assignment Schedule

We will be using Gradescope, which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope.

As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Dominican email, and your password can be changed at https://gradescope.com/reset_password. The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

**The assignments cover debugging, refactoring, unit testing and architecture topics.**. Please refer to [exercises](/Exercises/README.md) and for details.

For assignments and due dates, please refer to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com).

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Obtain at least 70% cumulative score on all assignments in Gradescope.
- Complete and submit a [Self Reflection] and [Learning Objectives Self-Assessment] on the last day of class.
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy.
