# Refactoring: Composing Methods

In this series of exercises, we practice various refactoring techniques. You may want to run pylint on this script to find any pep8 compliance issues. Fix as much as issues you can.

## Exercise 1: 'Extract Method' Technique

Study the file '**extract_method.py**'. Use 'extract method' technique to improve modularity of the code. 

## Exercise 2: 'Inline Method' Technique

Study the file '**inline_method.py**'. Use 'inline method' technique to improve readability of the code. 

## Exercise 3: 'Replace Temp with query' Technique

Study the file '**replace_temp_with_query_fowler.py**'. Use Replace Temp with query' technique to improve readability of the code. 

## Exercise 4: 'Introducing Explaining Variable' Technique

Study the file '**introduce_explaining_variable3.py**'. Use Replace Temp with query' technique to improve readability of the code. 

## Exercise 5: 'Extract Method' Technique

Study the file '**extract_method3.py**'. Use 'extract method' technique to improve modularity of the code. 

## Exercise 6: Various Techniques

Study the file '**replace_temp_with_query.py**'. Use 'Replace Temp with query' and 'Extract Method' techniques to improve readability of the code.

## Exercise 7: 'Split Temporary Variable' Technique

Study the file '**split_temp_variable.py**'. Use 'split temporary variable' technique to clarify the code (make it easier to understand its intent.)

## Exercise 8: 'Remove Assignment to Method Parameter' Technique

Study the file '**remove_assignment_to_param.py**'. Use 'remove assignment to method parameter' technique to prevent future mistakes/bugs.

## Exercise 9: 'Rename Method' Technique

Study the file '**rename_method.py**'. Use 'rename method' technique to clarify the code (make it easier to understand its intent.)

## Exercise 10: 'Split Temporary Variable' Technique

Study the file '**split_temp_variable2.py**'. Use 'split temporary variable' technique to clarify the code (make it easier to understand its intent.)

## Exercise 11: 'Introducing Explaining Variable' Technique

Study the file '**introduce_explaining_variable.py**'. Use Replace Temp with query' technique to improve readability of the code.
